# Cursor Rules: Of Gold And Grace Shopify Theme
# Curated from cursor.directory best practices
# Version: 2.5 - Post-Cycle Rules Closeout

project_goals:
  - Minimal cost: Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme only; no headless stack or paid services.
  - WCAG AA accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
  - Core Web Vitals optimization: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms.
  - SEO-first: Structured data, semantic HTML, performance-optimized assets.
  - Developer experience: Automated testing, linting, CI/CD, and comprehensive documentation.

languages:
  - liquid: Shopify templating with Online Store 2.0 sections/snippets
  - javascript: ES2020+ vanilla JS, modular assets/, no frameworks
  - css: Theme tokens, utility-first, responsive design
  - json: Configuration, locales, and structured data

guardrails:
  - No server-side code: Shopify Liquid only; no Node.js, PHP, or external runtimes.
  - Secrets management: API keys in theme settings only; never commit credentials.
  - External services: Free tier only; document all app installs in PR descriptions.
  - Performance budget: Bundle size < 100KB JS/CSS; defer non-critical assets.
  - CI Node version: Standardize on Node 20.x LTS for all GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Browser support: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (last 2 versions).
  - localStorage usage: Handle quota exceeded errors; no sensitive data storage; wishlist limited to product handles only.

code_style:
  liquid:
    - Sections/snippets architecture: Reusable, configurable components.
    - Conditional rendering: Use settings for feature toggles; avoid complex inline logic.
    - Data attributes: Use data-* for JavaScript hooks and state management.
    - Safe fallbacks: Defensive JSON-LD generation; handle missing metafields/settings.
    - Accessibility first: Alt text, ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure.
    - Performance: Lazy load images, optimize loops, cache expensive operations.
  javascript:
    - ES2020+ features: Async/await, optional chaining, nullish coalescing.
    - Modular architecture: One responsibility per file in assets/.
    - Client-side filtering: URL synchronization for bookmarkable states.
    - Progressive enhancement: Core functionality without JS; enhanced with JS.
    - State management: URL params for shareable states; localStorage for persistence.
    - Accessibility: Focus traps, keyboard navigation, ARIA live regions, announcements.
    - Error handling: Try/catch blocks, graceful degradation, user feedback.
    - No frameworks: Vanilla JS only; small utility functions.
  css:
    - Theme tokens: CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography.
    - Utility-first: Composable classes over monolithic components.
    - Responsive: Mobile-first with fluid typography and spacing.
    - Performance: Minimize specificity, avoid @import, optimize selectors.
    - Accessibility: Focus indicators, reduced motion, high contrast support.
    - No !important: Use specificity hierarchy instead.

files:
  - Core protection: layout/, config/, locales/ - never modify without review.
  - Theme configuration: config/settings_schema.json for all settings.
  - Component architecture: sections/ for pages, snippets/ for reusable parts.
  - Asset organization: assets/ for JS/CSS/images; __tests__/ for testing.
  - Documentation: README.md, .cursorrules, .github/ templates and guidelines.

patterns:
  - Quick View: data-quick-view="product-handle" on buttons.
  - Wishlist: data-wishlist-toggle with data-product-handle and data-product-title.
  - Collection Filters: data-tag-checkbox, data-price-min/max, data-availability-filter.
  - Product Media: Comprehensive snippet handling images/videos with responsive srcset/sizes (3D optional).
  - Responsive Images: srcset with multiple sizes + sizes attribute for performance.
  - Lazy Images: data-src + class="lazy" + width/height/aspect-ratio attributes.
  - Modals: data-focus-trap + aria-modal="true" + role="dialog".

contribution:
  - Scope Gate: Complete PR template Scope Gate checklist for any new features/settings/external domains.
  - Branch naming: feat/, fix/, refactor/, perf/, docs/, test/ prefixes.
  - Commit messages: Conventional commits with scope (sections/product-card).
  - PR requirements: Description, testing notes, screenshots for UI changes.
  - Code ownership: Review required for layout/, config/, core functionality.
  - Breaking changes: Document in PR description and commit footer.

commits:
  - Format: type(scope): description
  - Types: feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, chore
  - Scope: theme area (sections/product, snippets/card, assets/quick-view)
  - Breaking changes: Add "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer with migration notes
  - Examples: "feat(sections/product): add variant swatches, fix(snippets/card): resolve lazy loading CLS"

policies:
  - Scope Gate: Require explicit approval for new features, settings, external domains, or significant impacts.
  - Optional Feature Retention: Keep optional features only if actively used within 2 release cycles, or when user benefit outweighs maintenance cost.
  - CI Performance Budgets: JS+CSS bundles must stay under 100KB total (source sizes); 80KB triggers warnings. Test assets excluded. Report-only CI (no failures). Budgets defined in lighthouse-budgets.json and enforced by scripts/check-performance-budget.js.
  - Budget Governance: Request exceptions in PR description with mitigation plan; remediate within 2 weeks; document budget increases in PRs; Lighthouse budgets align with Core Web Vitals targets (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, FID <100ms).
