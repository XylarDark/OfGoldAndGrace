# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document the architectural decisions made for this project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format and includes:

- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision**: What decision was made and why?
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative outcomes?

## Process

1. **Identify**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Draft**: Create an ADR using the [template](adr-template.md)
3. **Discuss**: Share with stakeholders and gather feedback
4. **Decide**: Make the decision and document rationale
5. **Record**: Save the ADR and update status
6. **Communicate**: Share the decision with the team

## Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision considered but not chosen
- **Deprecated**: Previously accepted but no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (see ADR-XXX)

## ADR List

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](adr-001-initial-architecture.md) | Initial Project Architecture | Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) to create a new ADR
2. Number sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Update the ADR List above
4. Submit as part of a pull request following the standard process

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Clear record of why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Sharing**: New team members can understand historical context
- **Consistency**: Reference previous decisions for similar situations
- **Accountability**: Documented rationale for architectural choices
